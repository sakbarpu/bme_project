can be tied with research
use neural network
have project aligned with research

idea for app
business idea make a prototype
some cool application of deep learning
implement yourself

1 project = 4 or 5 or 6 homeworks
around 6 weeks for project

1 or 2 members in team
2 partners

due next week (Thursday 11th): 
short description of project
and team members

can implement papers
don't copy code available online
make sure know every line in code does

if project is something bigger than just 
mask rcnn then can just use mask rcnn code
available online

don't choose a project where we don't have
data available

even if the project fails just show at the
end that you have done a lot of work but 
didn't get the good results
tried so many things but didn't work
need to show that you made the effort

can also create dataset but have to train
a network on it
